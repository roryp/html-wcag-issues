# HTML WCAG Issues

This project contains a simple HTML file (`index.html`) that intentionally demonstrates common accessibility issues as outlined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The purpose of this project is to provide a clear example of various accessibility problems that can occur in web development.

## WCAG Issues Demonstrated

1. **Low Contrast Text**: The text color does not provide sufficient contrast against the background, making it difficult for users with visual impairments to read.

2. **Missing Alt Text for Images**: Images in the HTML file do not have alternative text attributes, which are essential for screen readers to convey the content of the images to visually impaired users.

3. **Missing Landmarks**: The HTML structure lacks proper landmarks (such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`), which help users navigate the page more easily.

4. **Improper Use of Headings**: The headings in the document are not used in a hierarchical manner, which can confuse users relying on screen readers to understand the structure of the content.

5. **Missing ARIA Attributes**: The file does not include necessary ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes that could enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.

This project serves as a resource for developers to understand and identify common accessibility pitfalls in their web applications.

## GitHub Action for Logging Accessibility Issues

We have implemented a GitHub Action that runs accessibility tests using `microsoft/accessibility-insights-action@v2` and logs any identified accessibility issues as GitHub issues. This automated process helps in tracking and addressing accessibility problems efficiently.

The action performs the following steps:
1. Runs the accessibility test on `index.html`.
2. Generates a report and saves it in the `./a11y-reports` directory.
3. Parses the report and creates GitHub issues for each identified accessibility problem.

By using this action, we ensure that accessibility issues are promptly logged and can be addressed in a timely manner.

## .gitignore File

The `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This helps to keep the repository clean and free from unnecessary files that do not need to be version controlled.

Common files and directories to be ignored include:
- `node_modules/` directory: Contains all the Node.js packages installed for the project.
- `.env` files: These files often contain sensitive information such as API keys and should not be committed to the repository.
- `dist/` directory: This directory typically contains the build output of the project.
- `.vscode/` directory: Contains workspace settings specific to Visual Studio Code.
- `a11y-reports/` directory: Contains the accessibility reports generated by the GitHub Action.
