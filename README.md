# HTML WCAG Issues

This project contains a simple HTML file (`index.html`) that intentionally demonstrates common accessibility issues as outlined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The purpose of this project is to provide a clear example of various accessibility problems that can occur in web development.

## WCAG Issues Demonstrated

1. **Low Contrast Text**: The text color does not provide sufficient contrast against the background, making it difficult for users with visual impairments to read.

2. **Missing Alt Text for Images**: Images in the HTML file do not have alternative text attributes, which are essential for screen readers to convey the content of the images to visually impaired users.

3. **Missing Landmarks**: The HTML structure lacks proper landmarks (such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`), which help users navigate the page more easily.

4. **Improper Use of Headings**: The headings in the document are not used in a hierarchical manner, which can confuse users relying on screen readers to understand the structure of the content.

5. **Missing ARIA Attributes**: The file does not include necessary ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes that could enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.

This project serves as a resource for developers to understand and identify common accessibility pitfalls in their web applications.
